                <p>JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with
                    first-class functions.
                    While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments
                    also use it, such as
                    Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm,
                    single-threaded, dynamic
                    language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming)
                    styles.</p>

                <p>Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language. Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are
                    trademarks or registered
                    trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two programming languages have a
                    very different
                    syntax, semantic, and use.</p>

                <h4>What you should already know:</h4>
                <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web.</li>
                    <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language.</li>
                    <li>Some programming experience.</li>

                </header>
                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive
                    (e.g., having
                    complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). JavaScript contains a standard library of
                    objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements
                    such as operators, control structures, and statements.</p>

                </header>
                <p>Getting started with JavaScript is easy: all you need is a modern Web browser. All web browsers come
                    with developer tools. Simply right click the screen on Google Chrome and click inspect. A box at the
                    bottom of the screen will appear. Under the table "Console" you can execute JavaScript expressions
                    in the current page. </p>

                <header>
                    <h2>Basics</h2>
                </header>
                <p>JavaScript borrows most of its syntax from Java, C, and C++, but it has also been influenced by Awk,
                    Perl, and Python.</p>
                <p>JavaScript is case-sensitive and uses the Unicode character set. For example, the word Fr端h (which
                    means "early" in
                    German) could be used as a variable name.</p>
                <code>let Fr端h = "foobar"</code>
                <p>But, the variable <span>fr端h</span> is not the same as <span>Fr端h</span> because JavaScript is case
                    sensitive.</p>
                <p>In JavaScript, instructions are called statements and are separated by semicolons (;).</p>
                <p>A semicolon is not necessary after a statement if it is written on its own line. But if more than one
                    statement on a
                    line is desired, then they must be separated by semicolons.
                    It is considered best practice, however, to always write a semicolon after a statement, even when it
                    is not strictly
                    needed. This practice reduces the chances of bugs getting into the code.</p>
                <p>
                    The source text of JavaScript script gets scanned from left to right, and is converted into a
                    sequence of input elements
                    which are tokens, control characters, line terminators, comments, or whitespace. (Spaces, tabs, and
                    newline characters
                    are considered whitespace.)</p>

                <p>The syntax of comments is the same as in C++ and in many other languages:</p>

                    // a one line comment <br>

                    * multi-line comment

                    <br>
                    
                    /* You can't, however, /* nest comments */ SyntaxError */

                <p>JavaScript has three kinds of variable declarations.</p>
                <p><span>var</span>: Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.</p>
                <code>
                        var fruit = "apple"
                    </code>
                <p><span>let</span>: Declares a block-scoped, local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.</p>
                <code>
                        let favoriteFood = "Chicken Tacos"
                    </code>
                <p><span>const</span>: Declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant.</p>
                <code>
                        const favoriteMovie = "How the Grinch Stole Christmas"
                    </code>

                </header>
                <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called
                    identifiers, conform
                    to certain rules.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($). Subsequent
                        characters can also be
                        digits (0-9).</li>
                    <li>Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase)
                        as well as "a" through
                        "z" (lowercase).</li>
                    <li>Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, $credit, and _name.</li>
